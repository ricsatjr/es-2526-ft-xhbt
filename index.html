        <div class="caption">The image shows a mangrove area with a murky brownish-green coloured and calm water near by. The water seems to be moving in one direction with movements a bit more uniformed, almost pattern like. These mangroves also feature a type of water that we learned about in ES. It's called brackish water, it features a green or brownish colour. Brackish water is a mix of saltwater and freshwater. It forms naturally in estuaries, the meeting point of saltwater and freshwater, and coastal aquifers. Though, it can also be a result of human activities such as excessive groundwater pumping. Its salinity can change daily due to tides, winds, or currents. Brackish water also supports unique ecosystems, having calmer currents and more undisturbed compared to other water. This makes it more possible for organisms to live or inhabit this type of water. At first glance, the image has a clear desire path leading toward the water. Mangroves and their aerial roots stand on either side, while the narrow trail cuts directly through them. To us, this path represents how nature records our presence. It's a trace left behind by repeated human movement. It could be people drawn toward the water, seeking curiosity, discovery, or calmness. The path carries meaning because it exists only through use; it shows how we reshape nature in subtle ways.</div>

        <div class="caption">There are many fossils in the dirt (Shells and corals mainly).
Near the top there is a faint change of color signalling a different layer.
 1. Weathering and Erosion:
The dirt had been broken down due to weathering, exposing the fossils of corals and other marine life inside of it. While erosion had transported these broken down pieces (sediments) by agents like water, wind, and or gravity, after which they became a part of the soil and dirt in a new location. 

2. Principle of Inclusions:
The fossils of corals and other marine life have become inclusions within the dirt/soil, showing that these organisms existed before the surrounding sediments were deposited. 

3. Principle of Faunal Succession:

The fossils of corals and other marine life helped determine the relative ages of rock layers using the principle of faunal succession.
 “That which is buried will eventually be revealed.” Just like fossils of marine life that were once buried in the soil, they were uncovered over time, helping us understand the history of the Earth.</div>

        <div class="caption">The viewers, could see that the image provides a wet sandy beach, where we can see colorful pebbles, sea shells, and sea glass, which creates a repeating streak pattern throughout the coast of the beach.
These patterns can be analyzed, which illustrates the idea:  "repeating streak pattern" is likely caused by the rhythmic action of waves, which would be the waves receding back, and swashing and backwashing of the waves.

The viewer can create their own imagination on how the process goes.
 What Q2 lessons does this relate to?

The photo we took is related to our topic of weathering and erosion. Weathering is when rocks are broken down into smaller pieces over time, caused by agents such as wind, water, and living organisms. Over time, larger rocks turn into sediments like sand and pebbles because of natural agents like the waves going back and forth and wind pushing against them. 
Erosion, on the other hand, is when the now remaining weathered sediments are being transferred from one place to another. 
As an example, the waves can push and carry the sand and pebbles towards the shoreline, creating the streak pattern on the sand when the waves recede.
It’s just like nature’s slow sculptor, where we can see the natural work of nature. This connects to our Q2 topics,  where waves patiently break rocks, and so this causes our Earth’s surface to be reshaped and transformed to better. What is it to you?

This picture that we took serves as an important role in our learning. It helped us understand the concept of erosion through means of on-site learning or spatial learning.
Seeing how erosion works in a real setting helped us understand the concept more by giving us a clearer vision of what erosion could look like and how it happens compared to reading about it in books or discussing it in class. It is also said that learning by doing or experiencing it first hand is often better because it promotes deeper understanding, better retention, and stronger critical thinking through active engagement, and real-world application.
Well, just like life, it gives a deeper analogy of how life sends us into a place we can belong, just like school, and then we leave our streaks (trails) there.</div>

        <div class="caption">The original picture (left) was taken on December 5, 2025, in the West Philippine Sea near the area of Bani, Rosario, La Union. It captures a part of a cliff, with corals, above sea level. The annotated picture (right) highlights the probable boundaries of the layers seen in the cliff. It also highlights some of the visible fossils of corals and seashells embedded in specific layers. These layers could determine the relative ages of the rocks and fossils with the Law of Superposition, which states that in undisturbed sedimentary rocks, the older layers are at the bottom and the younger layers are at the top. With this law, the fossils’ relative age could also be identified. Older fossils are found in lower layers, and younger fossils are found in higher layers. With these statements, we can see that in the annotated picture, certain layers of sedimentary rock are younger and certain ones are older. Moreover, the locations of the highlighted permineralized fossils in the sedimentary rock suggest their relative age.

These fossils could provide evidence that living organisms have evolved. Scientists can compare the anatomies of these fossils to present-day organisms to prove the occurrence of evolution. In the future, scientists can compare preserved remains or fossils, like in the annotated picture, to currently living organisms and see that older organisms that lived before have simpler anatomies than present-day living beings because organisms evolve to be more sophisticated and adaptable to a complicated environment. Furthermore, the law of Superposition provides a basis for the relative age of fossils and their existence. For example, the lowest fossil is the oldest among the highlighted fossils because it is embedded in a lower layer than the others, and the two highest fossils are the youngest because they are embedded highest. To us, it is not just a rock or cliff presented during the field trip. It may be an interesting evidence that this cliff near the West Philippine Sea has once been underwater. What supports this is the fossils of corals in the rock above sea level even though corals can only grow underwater. This is similar to the limestone in Pisay CAR Campus, because limestone only forms underwater but was seen on dry ground, suggesting that the cliff we saw in the West Philippine Sea and the limestone in our school have once been underwater and have been lifted up.</div>

        <div class="caption">We're looking straight into the past here. This isn't just dirt and rocks; it's an ancient graveyard of sea life, locked away for a long period of time. The process that makes these remains last so long often involves permineralization.

Those white bits are old shells and skeletal fragments from creatures like clams, snails, and corals. When they died, they were covered by mud and sand. Over time, that pressure turned the mud to rock. Water full of dissolved minerals seeped into every gap in the sediment and the shells. The minerals filled those empty spaces, making them solid rock. That's how something becomes a permineralized fossil.

Now that the site is exposed to air, it's falling apart. Rainwater is slightly acidic, slowly dissolving those shells. That chalky, pitted look is natural weathering in action, breaking down the fossils piece by piece. These incredible permineralized fossils tell a story of a former ocean, now slowly being worn away by the same natural processes that helped preserve them.
 This photo showcases several of our quarter two lessons in ES and Biology that we have previously learned and seen during the field trip. It features the concept of relative dating in our ES lesson and the concept of fossils in Biology. We could see the different layers of rocks in the annotated photo, which shows relative dating principles such as the principle of superposition, in which a sequence of rock layers could be seen, and the principle of vertical succession, where fossils could be seen in said layers, each getting progressively older. It shows past life forms or what we call fossils, which we can observe to be permineralized fossils; this also relates to our Biology lessons.

 Our group made a photo essay that shows permineralized fossils found in layered rock formations. The raw and annotated photos explain how these fossils formed and how they relate to concepts from our Quarter 2 Earth Science and Biology lessons, such as fossils and relative dating. This work shows how Earth’s environment changes over time, turning an ancient ocean into land.</div>

        <div class="caption">The brown soil has roots, rocks, and permineralized fossils included in it, such as the dead corals. They are dry, white and are partially buried. Upon counting, there are more than three dead corals.          In relation to a 2nd Quarter Lesson in Earth Science, one Relative Dating Principle is in the photograph. It is an example of Inclusions - there are rocks and permineralized fossils included in the soil layers, implying that the rocks/fossils at the bottom are older than the soil on top of them. 

        In Biology, we can relate the lesson Evidence of Evolution, specifically types of fossils, to our photograph. The fossils(dead corals) shown in the photo are permineralized fossils. These happen because once a coral dies, mineral-rich water fills in the coral’s pores, depositing minerals that harden over time and preserve the corals' structure.
           We find this image mind-blowing because it is an extraordinary experience to see dead corals on a beach. Looking at the photo, we can only think of a quote to conclude this essay, 

"The best memories should be like a fossil. No matter how time covers it up, its presence will always remind us of what has been." - Jean Maxine</div>

        <div class="caption">The Image shows a beach, consisting of wet sand and scattered seashells.

 What Q2 lessons does this relate to?

The photo we took is related to our topic of evolution because it shows organisms with shells that are adapted to survive in a beach environment, like the one we went to in Damortis. Over lots of generations, animals with traits like hard shells were more likely to survive because the shells, which are made from calcium carbonate, protect them from predators, waves, and drying out. These helpful traits were seen as “more fit” over other species and were passed down to their offspring through natural selection. The shells also show how organisms adapt to their surroundings. Over a long time, small changes like these can lead to different species becoming better suited to their environment and reproduce more offspring to come. It’s all just a rule of survival of the fittest; the more fit the species is to live and reproduce, the more likely it is to survive and pass on its traits to the next generation.

 What is it to you?

This picture that we took serves as an important role in our learning. It helped us understand the concept of erosion through means of on-site learning or spatial learning. Seeing how erosion works in a real setting helped us understand the concept more by giving us a clearer vision of what erosion could look like and how it happens compared to reading about it in books or discussing it in class. It is also said that learning by doing or experiencing it first hand is often better because it promotes deeper understanding, better retention, and stronger critical thinking through active engagement, and real-world application.
Well, just like life, it gives a deeper analogy of how life sends us into a place we can belong, just like school, and then we leave our streaks (trails) there</div>

        <div class="caption">From what we observed, the water is translucent and has little to no waves. The waterbed is made out of soft loamy mud or clay. The water being brackish means that the salinity and biodiversity are balanced and unique, creating specialized habitats. The photo relates to our Q2 lessons in Earth Science such as water distribution and water content. The mangroves provide natural barriers to winds and waves. They also act as natural filters, filtering 80%-90% of nitrates, phosphates, and suspended solids, leading to less eutrophication and healthier seagrass beds. Also, the waters are brackish water, a water mix between freshwater and saltwater. In other words, mangrove water is a mixture of waters. It’s nice to stay warm in  your own room. However, there’s still a world out there that’s waiting for us to lay our eyes on. Despite the things happening now, sometimes you just need a trip to somewhere that you haven’t repeatedly visited. After hours of staring at whiteboards and quiz papers, sometimes it feels like being stuck in an endless loop of academics. However, the trip that took place served as an opportunity to experience the grandeur of nature in person.</div>

        <div class="caption">In the picture it is visible that the Sea and a Freshwater body are converging through a shallow but wide area. It is also visible that from this convergence a small bit of sand layers can be seen, and there are also some tiny round stones on the bottom of the bed of the convergence area. We can also see massive clouds in the back ground just above the ocean.  From these observations we can relate them with four lessons. One of the lessons, the Agents of Weathering, can be related to the photo because of the rocks at the bottom being smoothened out from different agents of weathering like the tides and wind. Secondly, we can relate the lesson on the Motion of Tides with the picture as we can see that Saltwater can push through the convergence, as seen with the small waves, and pull back causing the erosion of sand. Third, we can relate the clouds at the background with the lesson on the Water Cycle, for when water evaporates because of the heat of the sun small water droplets form and create clouds which can be seen in the background .Lastly, we can again go back to Relative Dating with the idea of Superposition and Original Horizontality being vaguely shown in the picture. 
 This for me picture is a look on how significant water is, not just in Biology, Physics, or Chemistry, but in Earth Science, as it can be many things such as an agent for weathering, an indicator for pollution, a key player in distributing heat using currents, and more. It shows that even the liquid we drink to survive, is also used to actively change the environment we live in.</div>

        <div class="caption">In the given picture, there are layers of soil with fossils embedded in them. To further clarify, the image appears to feature three distinct rock layers. The first layer appears to be composed solely of soil. The soil looks dark and very dry. The second layer, as we observed, looks like rock with something embedded in it. We later found out the things embedded in it are mostly permineralized fossils of corals, seagrass, and occasionally some shells. This rock layer looks like cream to whitish with very obvious embedment sticking out of the rock layer. Finally, underneath this is a very hard rock layer. This rock layer looks darker than the rest of the layers discussed. 

The embedded fossils show the creatures that once roamed our land, and here their remnants lie. We see permineralized fossils surrounded by layer upon layer of soil. Some of these fossils show mussels, clams, corals, snails, and even a nautilus. These fossils, which are hued a brilliant white, appear to have varying sizes; some are big, some are small. In size, they come in all sizes. Some are young, some are old, shades of white and shades of gold. When we talk about their forms, some are peculiar, some are dainty, and in number they are plentiful.
 The layers of soil that we observed are related to our topic last quarter of relative dating. We saw that there are different colors of soil, and we know that the topmost dark brown, almost black, is the youngest, then the light brown to yellow brown is the second youngest, then the cream to whitish is the third youngest, then the grayish brown is the second oldest, and the oldest is the dark gray. We can associate these ages according to superposition, a part of the topic in relative dating that states that the lower the layer, the older it is. Another thing we can associate with relative dating is the inclusions, or the small rocks/shells/fossils of corals, in the layers of soil/rock. We can say that these inclusions are older than the layer in which they are, because you cannot put a younger rock inside an older rock or layer. 

You've read our observations, but how does this connect to Biology? The fossils embedded within the layers of soil connect this observation to Biology because they provide evidence of ancient life and past environments. The presence of marine organisms such as corals (Class Anthozoa), mussels (Family Mytilidae), clams (Class Bivalvia), snails (Class Gastropoda), and a nautilus (Genus Nautilus, e.g., Nautilus pompilius) suggests that the area was once part of a marine ecosystem. Many of the coral fossils are permineralized, meaning minerals preserved their original structure. The varying sizes of the fossils indicate different life stages, showing that these organisms once lived and reproduced in this environment. Using the principle of superposition, we can also tell the ages of the fossils. The fossils found deeper in the soil are older, while those closer to the surface are younger. Looking back at the time we were traveling for the field trip, realizations and discoveries were made along the way. We chose this picture because it shows a lot about Earth Science and Biology, depicting concepts of these subjects that relate to our topics in the 2nd quarter. The picture reveals a lot about relative dating, and it made us realize how learning about relative dating is important when we want to know more about these rocks. Learning about which one is older and which one is younger is indeed interesting, and it helps us understand the Earth’s history, the sequence of its past events, and what these rocks have undergone over the past years, decades, centuries, and millennia.

In addition, we now have more knowledge about the fossils seen in the picture. These fossils are witnesses of the Earth’s past, and they are one of the reasons why we know about how life evolves until today and how our environment changes as time goes by. They are remains or traces left behind by the organisms from years ago, and we learned how significant they are in our lives as we learn and understand the Earth better.</div>
